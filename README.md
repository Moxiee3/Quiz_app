# Quiz_APP

On day 20 of the "30 Days 30 Apps Challenge," iâ€™ll create an interactive Quiz App using Flutter. This app will fetch questions from an external API, allowing users to test their knowledge across various topics. The quiz app will feature engaging and dynamic question content, randomized questions, and a scoring system to make the quiz experience fun and challenging.
